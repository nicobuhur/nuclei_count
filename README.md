# Nuclei Count

## Project Overview
This project is focused on the development of image processing algorithms to accurately count nuclei within biological images. The primary dataset used is BBBC002, which contains varied images of biological cell nuclei under different conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **Libraries**:
  - Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.
  - Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - Napari: For interactive visualization of large multi-dimensional images.
  - skimage: For image processing in Python.

## Setup and Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nuclei_count.git
cd nuclei_count
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
After setting up the project, you can run the Jupyter notebook to begin counting nuclei in your images. The notebook `nuclei_count.ipynb` includes detailed steps and code comments to guide you through the process.
